## Decision Logic Explanation

EPAS uses a rule-based scoring approach to recommend
levels of road priority for emergency vehicles.

The system considers:
- Urgency of the emergency
- Current traffic density
- Distance to hospital
- Presence of multiple emergencies

The output is a recommended priority level.
Final decisions are always expected to be made
by traffic authorities.
